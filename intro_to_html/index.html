    <h1> The Large Game Bird </h1>
    <p> The turkey is a large game bird that is divided into 5 sub-species in North America. Turkeys are an extremely sought after game bird in North America. The different subspecies are found in different parts of the country. Turkeys can be extremely difficult to harvest due to their eyesight and their nature to be weiry of anything that is suspicious. Turkeys mate during the spring, where a male (a Tom) find a female (a Hen) by strutting, which is when he displays all of his colors in his fan (his tail). A tom may mate with several hens during this time, which the hen then lays a clutch of eggs which she sits on for 28 days. After this period of mating, the toms and hens part ways. Turkeys can be found in wooded areas or fields where they are mostly hunted.  </p>

    <h2> Different Sounds of a Turkey </h2>
    <p> Turkeys make a variety of sounds reflecting on the time of year. In the spring time you can mostly find the males gobbling, occasionaly making yelping sounds similar to a hen. In the fall the male turkeys are mostly silent with rare yelping sounds. The hens use the same calling/sounds throughout the entire year. Some of the hens calls include a cluck, which is a single or short series of notes which she uses to communicate to other turkeys. They also make a purring sounds which is a soft rolling sound they make when they feel content and safe. Hens cackle, a fast series of irregularly spaced notes, which they make when they're flying up or down from their roost. Adult hens make an assembly call when the flock has been seperated, which is a loud series of yelps.  </p>
