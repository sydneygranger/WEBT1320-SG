        <h3>The Survival of Turkeys</h3>
             <p>Turkeys have evolved a variety of survival strategies that enable them to thrive despite facing numerous natural threats. One of their most significant advantages is their sharp vision, which is among the best in the animal kingdom. Their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads, providing a wide field of view that allows them to detect predators from great distances. Unlike humans, who rely heavily on depth perception, turkeys use rapid head movements to gauge distances accurately. Their ability to detect even the slightest movement helps them evade threats like foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and birds of prey.</p>
