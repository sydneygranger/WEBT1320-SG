             <p>Turkeys are fascinating birds native to North America. Known for their distinctive appearance and gobbling call, these birds have a rich history and play an important role in ecosystems and cultures. They can run at speeds of 25 mph and are capable of flying as fast as 55 mph. Turkeys spend most of their day on the ground, but will roost in trees overnight for protection. The turkey's face color can change depending on their mood at the time. An adult turkey has anywhere from 5,000 to 6,000 feathers, which the male turkey will use to attract a female. In the early 20th century, there were only 200,000 estimated wild turkeys in the U.S. However, thanks to conservation efforts, that number changed to approximately 6.5 million.</p>

         <h2 class="heading_style">Why Turkeys Matter</h2>
             <p>Turkeys are not only a symbol of Thanksgiving but also important to wildlife conservation. Turkeys are not only raised for their meat, but also for their economic value. They help maintain balance in their habitats by foraging for insects and seeds. Turkeys are both predators and prey, which helps increase the biodiversity of the ecosystems they live in. As poults (young turkeys), they consume various bugs and pests. Modern commercial turkeys are bred to grow quickly and have large breast muscles.</p>

        <h3 class="heading_style">The Survival of Turkeys</h3>
             <p>Turkeys have evolved a variety of survival strategies that enable them to thrive despite facing numerous natural threats. One of their most significant advantages is their sharp vision, which is among the best in the animal kingdom. Their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads, providing a wide field of view that allows them to detect predators from great distances. Unlike humans, who rely heavily on depth perception, turkeys use rapid head movements to gauge distances accurately. Their ability to detect even the slightest movement helps them evade threats like foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and birds of prey.</p>
